Inline question 1:
Describe the misclassification results that you see. Do they make sense?

Y𝑜𝑢𝑟𝐴𝑛𝑠𝑤𝑒𝑟: Yes, facture and color scheme of the miscassified pictures look right.
But object color and background color of some images are swapped.
Pictures with non-swapped colors look close to the regular "cat" or "plane" - model isn't saturated.
