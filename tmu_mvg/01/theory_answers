1.a Show that sets are linearly independent:
  Vector set v is linearly independent if a1*v1 + .. an*vn = 0 is true only when a1 ,, an equals zero
  So if we have 3*3 matrix:
    (v1_1, v1_2, v1_3) - v1
    (v2_1, v2_2, v2_3) - v2
    (v3_1, v3_2, v3_3) - v3

    so to prove a1*v1 + a2*v2 + a3*v3 = 0 is true only when a1, a2, and a3 equal zero we should solve system of linear equations and find out a1, a2 and a3:

    a1*v1_1 + a2*v2_1 + a3*v3_1 = 0
    a1*v1_2 + a2*v2_2 + a3*v3_2 = 0
    a1*v1_3 + a2*v2_3 + a3*v3_3 = 0

  1)
    (1, 1, 1)
    (1, 1, 0)
    (1, 0, 0)

    a1 + a2 + a3 = 0
    a1 + a2 = 0
    a1 = 0

    There is only one solution (0, 0, 0) - so the set of vectors is linearly independent

  2)
    (2, 1, 0)
    (1, 1, 0)

    a1*2 + a2 = 0
    a1 + a2 = 0

    There is only one solution (0, 0) - so the set of vectors is linearly independent

  3)
    (2, 1, 0)
    (3, 1, 0)
    (0, 0, 1)
    (1, 0, 1)

    a1*2 + a2*3 + a4 = 0 *(1)
    a1 + a2 = 0 (2)
    a3 + a4 = 0 (3)

    a2 + a4 = 0 (4) // (1) - 2(2)
    a1 + a2 = 0
    a3 + a4 = 0

    This system of linear equations has inifinte solutions (for example (-1, 1, 1, -1)) so the of vectors is linearly dependent

1.b Show whether set of vectors span R3
  Span of the matrix is the number of linearly independent rows in the matrix

  1)
    (1, 1, 1)
    (1, 1, 0)
    (1, 0, 0)
    It spans R3 since number of linearly independent rows is 3

  2)
    (2, 1, 0)
    (1, 1, 0)
    Nope, since number of linearly independent rows is 2

  3)
    (2, 1, 0)
    (3, 1, 0)
    (0, 0, 1)
    (1, 0, 1)
    Yep, since number of linearly independent vectors is 3

1.c Check wheter set of vectors form a basis R3
  Set of vectors form a basis R3 if it's linearly independent set and it spans R3

  1)
    (1, 1, 1)
    (1, 1, 0)
    (1, 0, 0)
    Forms basis since it linearly independent and spans R3

  2)
    (2, 1, 0)
    (1, 1, 0)
    Doesn't form basis since it doesn't span R3

  3)
    (2, 1, 0)
    (3, 1, 0)
    (0, 0, 1)
    (1, 0, 1)
    Doesn't form basis since it linearly dependent

2. Prove that the following sets form a group under matrix multiplication
  Invertible symmetric matrices.
    They don't form a group since closure property isn't satisfied - product of two invertible symmetric matrices isn't always an invertible symmetric matrix
  Matrices whose determinant equals -1.
    They don't form group since they violate clouse property - determinant of product equals 1
  Matrices whose determinant bigger that 0.
    They form group since they follow all four properties - in particualr they obey clouse property since determinant of product also is positive

3. Prove or disprove. There exist 4 non-zero vectors from R3 which pairwise orthogonal.
  Let's create a set of vectors from them. We get 4x3 matrix. And maximum rank of this matrix is 3 (since max rank is min(rows, columns)) -> there is maximum 3 linearly independent vectors. This is contradiction since by statement definition we should have 4 independent vectors. So by contradiction it's impossible to have 4 R3 pairwise orthogonal vectors.
