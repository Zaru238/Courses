Exercise 1:
  1. ((0.25, 01), (0.2, 0.5)) isn't symmetric.
     ((i0.25, -0.3), (-0.3, 0.5)) -is positive matrix since its symmetric and it's determinant greater than zero.

  2. For being non-positive matrix should have non-positive determinant. Since this matrix is diagonal one determinant is the product of diagonal elements. So the biggest u is 3 for which matrix remains non-positive.

  3. The matrix isn't orthogonal

Exercise 2:
  1. label_global_frame = compose_transform((x, y), theta).dot(lx, ly, 1)
  2. label_robot_frame = compose_transform_inverse((x, y), theta).dot(lx, ly, 1)
